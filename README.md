# course_alert-API
[In development] API for search and alert (UB Courses) 

## Requirements
- Will upload a requirment installtion file later on when everything is complete.
- You will need to modify the configuration.py file for sql, twilio and email.
- The current reuirements and most likely final requirements are:
  - Flask, Flask-RESTful
  - Twilio
  - urllib
  - smtplib
  - psycopg2
  - json

## Notes
This should only be personal use as it is vulnerable to attack. I initially started a public version that has authentication, hashing and some input data cleaning but due to time and a request from a friend this should get you going for personal use.
